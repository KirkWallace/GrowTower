# GrowTower
# Author: Kirk

This project is just a simple non-interrupting, multi-timer, clock cycle counter for micro processors. 

Using the CountTimer.cpp and CountTimer.h files you can create timer objects to hold and let you know when a timer has finished. 
The VerticalGrowTower_v1 file, is a simple program to turn on an off lights and a watering pump for my vertical grow system.
